Serialization in java is process of writing(persisted) state of 
object in Byte stream.

The reverse is "Deserializtion" where byte-stream converted into 
object.

Both are platform independent. Means serialize in one platform
and deserialize in another platform.


SERIALIZE
step 1: Create ObjectOutputStream from 
             object of 'new File("<FileName>")';
step 2: Create Book object
step 3: Implement "Serialziable" for Book class
step 4: UpCast and Write object into file using 'writeObject()';
//Book should implement "Serializable" to convert into stream

DESERIALE
step 1: Create ObjectInputStream from 
             object of 'new File("<FileName>")';
step 2: Downcast and Read object using 'readObject()';


IMP: use "transient" modifier to not get serialize or persist or write into Bye-Stream.
