	--Highlight Table=>
		colored table- Bigger the value 
					   Darker the color.
	How to set two colors based on business condition?
	=>	
Q.1. highlight the regions where shipping cost is 
	 more than 90000.
	 (to set 2 colors, select color scheme with word
	 "Diverging")->Stepped colors(2)->Advanced->set Center:
	
	--Pie Chart=>
		Always show % values in Pie chart labels.

	--Bubble Chart=>
		Same as Pie Chart but, each value is represented
		as a circle and size of the circle depends on the value.
		Showing % here is not mandatory.
	
	--TreeMap=>
		same as Bubble chart, uses rectangle.
		Area & color of rectangle are decided by value.
		-Treemap doesn't support any type of sorting.
		-Color scheme is similar to Highlight Table.
		-Treemap with Grouping=>
		
	
--How to convert a dimension to COUNT?
	1) Convert dimension "ORDER ID" to COUNT to
	   display no.of orders.
	
	COUNT vs COUNTD
	  |			|
	all 	   all
	values     Unique
	with       values.
	duplicates.
	
	-- Bar Chart=>
		1) regular
		2) Side by side
		3) 100% stack
	1) Regular
		How to set 2 colors in Bar chart using
		business condition/

		This chart is used to compare two dimensions
		based on measure value. Here both dimensions
		are added either on rows or columns. 
		Total bars created = no. of values in dimension 1 *
								no.of values in dimension 2
		
		-for color use 2nd dimension

	2) 100% stack=>
		a) drag  a first dimension in rows.
		b) drag measure in column to create bar chart.
		c) Go to Analysis menu & select percent by "Row"
		   to change bar to 100% bar.
		d) drag measure on Label button.
		e) finally drag second dimension on color button
	
	-- Line Chart=>
			a) Discrete (Blue Color)

			e.g.1) Year
				2) Quarter
				3) Month
